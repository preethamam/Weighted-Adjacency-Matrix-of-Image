# Weighted-Adjacency-Matrix-of-Image
Creates a weighted adjacency matrix from a energy matrix for an image. Average, similarity and dissimilarity between the nodes i,j can be computed. If a custom energy matrix is provided, the same functions can be used to fill the adjacency matrix with edge weights.
